|    Change Log    |
+------------------+
1.5.0
-Removed some useless code.
-Removed "AvatarIcons" property alias. Use "Avatars" instead.
-"CSteamUser::Groups" property now returns an array of "CSteamUserGroup"s.
-"CSteamUser::Friends" property now returns an array of "CSteamUserFriend"s.
-"CSteamUser::InGameInfo" property now returns "CSteamUserInGameInfo".
-"CSteamUser::MostPlayedGames" property now returns an array of "CSteamUserMostPlayedGame"s.
-"CSteamUser::WebLinks" property now returns an array of "CSteamUserWebLink"s.
-Added "CSteamUser::IsOnline()" and "CSteamUser::IsInGame()" methods. Remember: unlike "$user->OnlineState=='online'", "$user->IsOnline()" also returns true if the user is in a game.
-Original source code now contains multiple files and gets compiled into one file before release.
-Renamed "PSCache" to "CPHPSteamCache".
-Added new abstract class "CSteamMagicComponent".
-Fixed a bug in caching.
-Changed "CSteamUser::GetMergedXMLData()" and "CSteamUser::GetMergedXMLDataArray()" functions' to continue instead of returning false when missing data found.
-Renamed all "Steam64ID"s to "SteamID64". (Typo correction.)
-Sending a HEAD request instead of a GET request to detect profile page redirections. This method should be faster and IS more compatible.
-Added "CPHPSteam::CDR2XML()" and "CPHPSteam::CDR2CSV()" functions. (These functions use steamCooker's "cdrTool".)
1.4.0
-Fixed $XMLAddress not being cached.
-Merged "CSteamTools" and "CCDRTools" into "CPHPSteam".
-Removed "CSteamUser::GetProfileInfoValue()". You can use "$user->PINAME" instead of "$user->GetProfileInfoValue('PINAME')".
-Improved behaviour of the script against unexistant user profile information.
-Added "PrimaryGroupIndex" to "CSteamUser" propreties. ($user->PrimaryGroupIndex, $user->GetPrimaryGroupIndex())
-"$user->XMLAddress" is not available for public access anymore. That's because it might not be available in some times.
-Improved caching in "CSteamUser::__construct()".
-Reorganized caching constants.
-Moved command definitions for "CSteamGDS" and "CSteamCS" in classes as constants.
-Removed "GDS_CLIENT_VERSION" and "CS_CLIENT_VERSION" constants.
-Added support for using "$user->Valid".
-Added support for getting an array value at a specific index by using "Get*" commands like "$user->GetGroups($user->PrimaryGroupIndex)". (That get's the primary group info.)
1.3.0
-Ugh, removed "SteamUniverse" and "SteamAccountType" abstract classes. Couldn't find a decent method to make use of them.
-Implemented RBPFC1's "CSteamGDS" and "CSteamCS" classes.
-Added "CCDRTools" for easier use.
-Overall improvements and fixes.
1.2.0
-Removed deprecated methods.
-Added dynamic "Get*" function support. You can use "CSteamUser::Get[InfoName]()" to get any "string" you want from "UserXML/Profile".
-Added direct access to results of "Get*" functions. (For example "$user->Groups" gives the same result with "$user->GetGroups()".)
-Added "GetGroups', "GetFriends', "GetGames', "GetInGameInfo', "GetFavoriteGame" and "GetWebLinks" for easily getting arrays from complicated XML parsing. (Dump them to see what you can get...)
-Fixed "CSteamTools::GetSteamID()".
-Unexistence of group and friend data is not fatal anymore.
-Removed "USAGE" file from the package. (Example PHP script will be added in the future...)
1.1.0
-Moved "CSU_*" functions in "CSteamUser" to new "CSteamTools" class and added some more little tools.
-Added "SteamUniverse" and "SteamAccountType" abstract classes for future use.
-Removed "Full Headers" functionality.
-Improved speed and functionality of "CSteamTools::GetCustomURL" and renamed it to "GetXMLAddress".
-Removed "PHPSTEAM_STEAMCOMMUNITY" and "PHPSTEAM_CURLFORMAT" constants.
-Renamed "PHPSTEAM_PROFILESFORMAT" constant to "PHPSTEAM_PROFILE".
-Added support for both Direct and Custom URL profiles.
-Fixed values being messed up with public accounts.
1.0.0
-First release.
